# Advanced web development 2 report

### Bristol pollution report


### Skills

I have primarily worked with javascript, charting data and displaying data in multiple different ways, I also have experience with MERN stack and continue in a primarily web development career path, the skills I hope to utilise for this project are those of previous around data visualisation and to learn more about data processing and formating.

### Conquer and divide / normalize to XML
The first part of the assignment was the hardest part for me, as this was not something I had done before, in which firstly I split our one larger file of pollution data into 18 smaller files and then turning those files into XML using another script. The first script was written with a fairly easy structure once I was given help, and once I looked up the explode function and was able to implement this, the speed of my script increased significantly. Setting up the second script was hard initially because I have had little experience with this style of coding in both creating scripts and formatting an XML schema which is a guideline in which our XML follows so that we only receive the XML that follows our guidelines.

### Creating a schema

For the schema, this was a little easier, making use of the tools already provided by oxygen to create a stricter schema, allowed me to minimise errors in data according to the air quality data strategy and then again create a system where the data could be checked in accordance with the assignment example when I converted my data from CSV to XML.

### Charting data

For the scatter graph I created a system where the initial data goes through, creating a switch statement to recieve my values and then using a average function to make calculate the data average out over the month for Nox. Unforchnatley I experienced issues with both the other charts and was unable to complete them leaving sugnificant marks still alavliabe had I been able to complete the map I would have averaged the data from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2019 and mapped that in accordance to location and the level of Air Quality Strategy compliance for no2.
