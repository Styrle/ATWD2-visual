### Bristol polution report

For the charting of the data I decided to use google charts as it had a clear structure, uisng a setup function and then a self implemented update function where I could add data to and call it whenever the chart would need to be updated. This created a easier system to manage ststems within the layout and DOM elements implemented into the design of the project
